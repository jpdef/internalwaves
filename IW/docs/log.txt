Log of Research Starting July 1st

Mon Jul 1 10:40:28 PDT 2019 :: Read over agenda for meeting re wrote questions and made small impovements to code.
Mon Jul 1 10:41:12 PDT 2019 :: Read more about spiceness and its relation to displacement field.
Mon Jul 1 15:50:38 PDT 2019 ::Meeting covered

    Dispersion in regards to wavevector angle
        large wavelength (near interial low frequency)
        small wavelength(near N high frequency)
    EVP solver takes h-wavenumber as input, how can a I use frequency w/o knowing dispersion for general N?
        Precompute dispersion curve and interpolate to map omega to k
    Power spectrum and its relation to correlation times
        thin power spectrum : long decorrelation
        board power spectrum : short decorrelation
    GM relates observed ocean behavior to a distribution of internal wave frequencies. TFO will  predict of ocean behavior with a fitted spectrum

AI:

    Construct temperature field with assembly of modes (maybe just one to start)
    Re-read GM 75
    Build tool to extract statistical diagnostics from a internal wave field

Wed Jul 3 16:07:28 PDT 2019 :: Finished reading GM75 working on my understanding of co-spectra and power spectra. Wrote Code to analyze spectra of wkbj code.
Mon Jul 29 10:31:45 PDT 2019 :: Came back from vacation, sent email to mentee, commented TS notebook
Mon Jul 29 10:36:09 PDT 2019 :: made a script to log from cmd line
Mon Jul 29 13:13:13 PDT 2019 :: made scalar field class, it is distorted by the iwf and will show the iwf affects on observables such as temperature
Mon Jul 29 15:50:58 PDT 2019 :: meeting with bruce about inversion methods, y = H x + r
Tue Jul 30 14:01:38 PDT 2019 :: read first chapter of tarantola on inverse problem
Tue Jul 30 15:50:14 PDT 2019 :: read part of second chapter of wuncsh stopped page 46
Thu Aug 8 18:19:33 PDT 2019 :: wrote multidimensional inversion, nessecary to get correct amplitude for any dimension



Fri Aug 30 12:14:15 PDT 2019 Summary of Summer Research
-Solved IW modes using both ideal and real ocean profiles using the following techniques
    -BVP
    -WKB
    -EVP

-Learned about GM spectrum and implementing random phases and amplitudes to the simulations
-From a linear 2D IW simulation with plane waves and dispersion relation
-Wrote tool in R to extract simulated data as if it were a real data file.
-Created a model inversion in R to return model paramters from calcualtion made on simulated data
-Wrote a linear 3D IW simulation from the 2D simulations, also has wavenumber degree of freedom in terms of direction
-Made 3D inversion for that model

Thu Sep 19 14:02:49 PDT 2019 :: read through old notes about dispersion, trying to implement velocity output paramters
